# Raw Data Links

The first link provides water quality data from all sampling points in Devon and Cornwall - ***water data***.

The second link provides sampling point information for the catchment specified at the end of the URL, including their IDs. Knowing the sampling point IDs for each river, we can ***filter the river data by catchment***.
