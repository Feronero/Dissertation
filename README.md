Annual water quality data from all sampling points in Devon and Cornwall - [water data](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/download/new)

Information on all sampling points within the catchment specified at the end of the URL - including their IDs. Knowing the sampling point IDs for each river, we can [filter the river data by catchment](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/id/sampling-point.html?search=hayle) (Just change the final argument in the URL to the desired catchment).
